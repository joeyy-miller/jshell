## jshell
A very simple rudimentary command line shell that I developed in Python for personal use but it is encouraged to branch the code and create your own version.

# Commands:
+ about: 
+ help: 
+ pwd: 
+ ls: 
+ cd: 
+ date: 
+ time: 
+ del: 
+ exit: 
+ mk: 
+ mkdir: 
+ make: 
+ rm: 
+ rmdir: 
+ echo:
