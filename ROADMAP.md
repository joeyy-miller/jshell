# jshell Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned features and improvements for the jshell project. The roadmap is subject to change based on feedback, priorities, and resource availability.

## Version 1.0 (first release)

### Command Autocompletion
- Implement command autocompletion using the `readline` module or a similar library.
- Suggest commands, file names, or directory names based on user input.

### Command History
- Store the command history and allow users to navigate through previous commands using the up and down arrow keys.
- Implement commands like `history` to display the command history and `!<number>` to execute a command from the history.

### Piping and Redirection
- Add support for piping commands using the `|` operator to pass the output of one command as input to another.
- Implement output redirection using `>` and `>>` to redirect command output to files.

### Environment Variables
- Allow users to set and access environment variables using commands like `export` and `env`.
- Expand environment variables in user input and command arguments.

## Version 1.1

### Scripting Support
- Introduce a scripting language or support for executing shell scripts.
- Allow users to write and execute scripts containing multiple commands and control structures.

### Alias Support
- Implement an `alias` command to allow users to define custom aliases for frequently used commands.
- Expand aliases in user input before executing commands.

### Wildcard Expansion
- Support wildcard characters like `*` and `?` for file and directory matching.
- Expand wildcards in command arguments to match multiple files or directories.

## Version 1.2

### User Profiles
- Allow users to create and manage multiple profiles with different settings and configurations.
- Implement commands to switch between profiles and customize profile-specific settings.

### Plugin System
- Design a plugin architecture that allows users to extend jshell's functionality.
- Provide an API for developers to create and integrate custom plugins.

### Network Commands
- Implement network-related commands like `ping`, `traceroute`, and `curl`.
- Add support for remote file operations using protocols like SS
## Version 1.3

### Improved Error Handling
- Enhance error handling mechanisms to provide more informative and user-friendly error messages.
- Implement error recovery techniques to prevent the shell from crashing on errors.

### Testing and Continuous Integration
- Write unit tests to ensure the correctness and stability of jshell's functionality.
- Set up continuous integration to automatically run tests and perform code quality checks.

### Documentation and Help System
- Expand the built-in help system to provide more detailed information about commands and their usage.
- Generate comprehensive documentation, including command references an
## Version 1.4

### Customizable Prompt
- Allow users to customize the command prompt by specifying a format string.
- Support dynamic elements in the prompt, such as the current directory, username, or git branch.

### Performance Optimization
- Profile the jshell codebase to identify performance bottlenecks.
- Optimize critical sections of code to improve overall performance and responsiveness.

## Future Versions

- Explore additional features and improvements based on user feedback and project goals.
- Consider integrating with popular tools and frameworks to enhance functionality and interoperability.
- Continuously refine and update the roadmap to align with the evolving needs of the jshell user community.

Please note that the roadmap is a living document and may be updated as my project progresses.


# Improvment Ideas

+ Use consistent naming conventions: The code uses a mix of naming conventions for variables and functions (e.g., camelCase, snake_case, PascalCase). It would be better to stick to a single naming convention throughout the codebase for consistency and readability.
+ Modularize the code: Consider breaking down the code into smaller, more focused functions or modules. This will make the code more modular, easier to understand, and maintainable. For example, you could separate the command implementations into separate functions or modules.
+ Use more descriptive variable names: Some variable names like word1, word2, word3 are not very descriptive. Consider using more meaningful names that convey the purpose or content of the variables.
+ Handle exceptions consistently: In some places, exceptions are caught and handled, while in others, they are not. It would be better to have a consistent approach to exception handling throughout the code. Consider using more specific exception types and providing informative error messages.
+ Avoid duplicating code: There are a few instances where similar code is repeated. For example, the code for printing colored output is duplicated in multiple places. Consider extracting such code into separate functions to avoid duplication and improve maintainability.
+ Use more descriptive comments: While the code has comments, some of them could be more descriptive to explain the purpose or functionality of certain code blocks or functions. This will make it easier for other developers (or yourself in the future) to understand the code.
+ Implement input validation: When processing user input, it's important to validate and sanitize the input to prevent unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. Consider adding input validation checks to ensure that the user input is in the expected format and within acceptable ranges.
+ Use more meaningful error messages: In some cases, the error messages could be more informative to help users understand what went wrong and how to resolve the issue. Consider providing more specific and user-friendly error messages.
+ Implement command-line argument parsing: Instead of relying solely on user input during runtime, consider implementing command-line argument parsing using libraries like argparse. This will allow users to provide options and arguments directly when running the script.
+ Implement a help system: While the code has a help command, consider implementing a more comprehensive help system that provides detailed information about each command, its usage, and available options. This will make it easier for users to understand and use the shell effectively.
